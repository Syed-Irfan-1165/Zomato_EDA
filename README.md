## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset. Zomato is a popular online restaurant search and discovery platform, providing detailed information about restaurants, including their locations, cuisines, average cost, ratings, and more. The dataset used in this analysis offers a comprehensive snapshot of restaurant data across various cities.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, stored in `zomato.csv`, is sourced from Kaggle and comprises several columns capturing diverse attributes of restaurants. Each row represents a single restaurant entry with details such as its ID, name, country code, location, cuisine type, average cost for two, ratings, and user votes.

### Columns Overview
- **Restaurant ID**: Unique identifier for each restaurant.
- **Restaurant Name**: Name of the restaurant.
- **Country Code**: Code representing the country where the restaurant is located.
- **City**: City where the restaurant is situated.
- **Address**: Street address of the restaurant.
- **Locality**: Specific locality within the city.
- **Locality Verbose**: Detailed locality description.
- **Longitude & Latitude**: Geographic coordinates of the restaurant.
- **Cuisines**: Types of cuisines served by the restaurant.
- **Average Cost for Two**: Average cost for dining for two people.
- **Currency**: Currency used for pricing.
- **Has Table Booking**: Binary indicator if the restaurant offers table booking.

- **Rating Color & Text**: Color and corresponding text representation of the rating.
- **Votes**: Number of votes received by the restaurant.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to explore and gain insights into the Zomato dataset. Through EDA, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data that can provide valuable information for various stakeholders, including consumers, restaurateurs, and Zomato itself.

## Setup
To run the analysis code in this repository, you will need the following:
- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.)

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Download the `zomato.csv` file and ensure it is accessible in your working environment.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use the provided code to load and explore the dataset. Perform descriptive statistics, visualizations, and other analytical techniques to understand the data.
3. **Insights Generation**: Identify interesting patterns, correlations, and outliers in the data. Document your findings and interpretations.
4. **Visualization**: Create visual representations (e.g., plots, charts) to communicate insights effectively.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize key findings and implications derived from the analysis.
